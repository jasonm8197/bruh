Use the registration program provided with the game. It allows you to enter
a personal registration code to instantly register Digging Jim and gives
you the means to obtain it. This is done by filling out a secure online
form on the WWW or create a form with the program that can be printed and
sent or faxed. The registration fee is 20 USD(other currencies are accepted
if you use postal registration) and ALL registrations go through our payment
processing partner Kagi which is a well established american business that
provides such services for shareware developers. If you use online registration
you will usually get your personal code by email within a working day.
All major credit cards are accepted!
