-----------------------------------------------------
This file contains important information about the game Digging Jim by Persei
Entertainment.


Distributing Digging Jim
------------------------
You may distribute the install-files of the unregistered version of Digging Jim 
as long as you keep them completely unchanged and no money is charged in the 
process. Distribution of a registered version and/or registration keys is
strictly prohibited.


Version history
---------------
1.00 : Initial release.
1.01 : Improved sound playback on some systems.


System requirements
-------------------
Pentium class processor (133 Mhz or better is recommended)
Videocard with good 2d performance (2 MB videoram or more is strongly recommended) 
Windows 95/98 or NT4.0+
DirectX 3.0 or higher
16 MB RAM

Optional:
16 bit soundcard, Joystick/Gamepad

Digging Jim will probably run on most modern PCs, but if your system is slow the
graphics will be more jerky. A fast videocard with good drivers can really boost 
game performance. Be sure to close all other programs and explorer windows before 
launching Digging Jim to free up as much resources as possible.


How to play Digging Jim
-----------------------
See the manual which is installed together with the game. If you ever played
games such as Boulder Dash on the classic 8-bit machines you are well prepared. ;)


Troubleshooting
---------------

Problem  : The game refuses to start with a "Unable to initialize DirectDraw" 
           message!
Solution : Try to (re)-install DirectX. At writing time the most recent version 
           is 6.0. If your videocard has less than 2 MB you and you keep running
           into this message you will probably have to invest in more videomemory
           or a new adapter to play Digging Jim. The latest version of DirectX
           can be downloaded from Microsoft from this URL:
           http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.asp

Problem  : The game throws a "Unable to initialize DirectSound" at me.
Solution : If you have a working soundcard and still get this error you may try to 
           re-install DirectX. In case that you don't own a soundcard you can avoid
           this message by saving the settings in options with the audio set to "off".

Problem  : The graphics is jerky!
Solution : If the scroll and sprites moves in big blocky steps it could be because
           of a slow system. It is perfectly playable, but it looks a lot better on
           a more powerful computer.

           Another purely cosmetic problem can arise if your graphicscard defaults
           to for example 70 or 72 Hz in 640x480. Digging Jim feeds the videosystem
           sixty times a second to provide smooth scroll and movements when it dosn't 
           have to drop frames because of a slow system. It can, however, run a bit
           out of sync if the videohardware updates the screen at a rate that lies
           just above this(the problem greatly diminishes when refreshrates are
           higher such as 90 Hz). Perfectly your system would set the display
           refreshrate to 60 or 120 Hz in 640x480 which provides absolutely perfect
           sync. You can try the "Set Refreshrate" option which will attemt to
           force your videocard to 60 Hz in 640x480.

Problem  : Digging Jim dosn't respond properly to my joystick.
Solution : Make sure that Joystick Control is set to "on" in options. If that isn't
           the problem check that the joystick is properly installed and calibrated. 
           This can be done from the "game controllers" applet in your Control Panel.

Problem  : I'm totally stuck!
Solution : Check the tips and tricks section in the manual. It provides solutions for
           specific situations.
